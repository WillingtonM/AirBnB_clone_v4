Making the AirBnB Dynamic

1. Cash only

Write a script that starts a Flask web application:

Based on web_flask, copy: web_flask/static, web_flask/templates/100-hbnb.html, web_flask/__init__.py and web_flask/100-hbnb.py into the web_dynamic folder
Rename 100-hbnb.py to 0-hbnb.py
Rename 100-hbnb.html to 0-hbnb.html
Update 0-hbnb.py to replace the existing route to /0-hbnb/
If 100-hbnb.html is not present, use 8-hbnb.html instead

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v4$ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m web_dynamic.0-hbnb
* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
....
One problem now is the asset caching done by Flask.

To avoid that, you will add a query string to each asset:

In 0-hbnb.py, add a variable cache_id to the render_template. The value of this variable must be an UUID (uuid.uuid4())

In 0-hbnb.html, add this variable cache_id as query string to each <link> tag URL



2. Select some Amenities to be comfortable!

For the moment the filters section is static, let’s make it dynamic!

Replace the route 0-hbnb with 1-hbnb in the file 1-hbnb.py (based on 0-hbnb.py)

Create a new template 1-hbnb.html (based on 0-hbnb.html) and update it:

Import JQuery in the <head> tag
Import the JavaScript static/scripts/1-hbnb.js in the <head> tag
In 1-hbnb.html and the following HTML files, add this variable cache_id as query string to the above <script> tag
Add a <input type="checkbox"> tag to the li tag of each amenity
The new checkbox must be at 10px on the left of the Amenity name
Add to the input tags of each amenity (<li> tag) the attribute data-id=":amenity_id" => this will allow us to retrieve the Amenity ID from the DOM
Add to the input tags of each amenity (<li> tag) the attribute data-name=":amenity_name" => this will allow us to retrieve the Amenity name from the DOM
Write a JavaScript script (static/scripts/1-hbnb.js):

Your script must be executed only when DOM is loaded
You must use JQuery
Listen for changes on each input checkbox tag:
if the checkbox is checked, you must store the Amenity ID in a variable (dictionary or list)
if the checkbox is unchecked, you must remove the Amenity ID from the variable
update the h4 tag inside the div Amenities with the list of Amenities checked



3. API status

Before requesting the HBNB API, it’s better to know the status of this one.

Update the API entry point (api/v1/app.py) by replacing the current CORS CORS(app, origins="0.0.0.0") by CORS(app, resources={r"/api/v1/*": {"origins": "*"}}).

Change the route 1-hbnb to 2-hbnb in the file 2-hbnb.py (based on 1-hbnb.py)

Create a new template 2-hbnb.html (based on 1-hbnb.html) and update it:

Import the JavaScript static/scripts/2-hbnb.js in the <head> tag (instead of 1-hbnb.js)
Add a new div element in the header tag:
Attribute ID should be api_status
Align to the right
Circle of 40px diameter
Center vertically
At 30px of the right border
Background color #cccccc
Also add a class available for this new element in web_dynamic/static/styles/3-header.css:
Background color #ff545f
Write a JavaScript script (static/scripts/2-hbnb.js):

Based on 1-hbnb.js
Request http://0.0.0.0:5001/api/v1/status/:
If in the status is “OK”, add the class available to the div#api_status
Otherwise, remove the class available to the div#api_status
To start the API in the port 5001:

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v4$ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db HBNB_API_PORT=5001 python3 -m api.v1.app



4. Fetch places

Replace the route 2-hbnb with 3-hbnb in the file 3-hbnb.py (based on 2-hbnb.py)

Create a new template 3-hbnb.html (based on 2-hbnb.html) and update it:

Import the JavaScript static/scripts/3-hbnb.js in the <head> tag (instead of 2-hbnb.js)
Remove the entire Jinja section of displaying all places (all article tags)
Write a JavaScript script (static/scripts/3-hbnb.js):

Based on 2-hbnb.js
Request http://0.0.0.0:5001/api/v1/places_search/:
Description of this endpoint here. If this endpoint is not available, you will have to add it to the API (you can work all together for creating this endpoint)
Send a POST request with Content-Type: application/json and an empty dictionary in the body - cURL version: curl "http://0.0.0.0:5001/api/v1/places_search" -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
Loop into the result of the request and create an article tag representing a Place in the section.places. (you can remove the Owner tag in the place description)
The final result must be the same as previously, but now, places are loaded from the front-end, not from the back-end!



5. Filter places by Amenity

Replace the route 3-hbnb with 4-hbnb in the file 4-hbnb.py (based on 3-hbnb.py)

Create a new template 4-hbnb.html (based on 3-hbnb.html) and update it:

Import the JavaScript static/scripts/4-hbnb.js in the <head> tag (instead of 3-hbnb.js)
Write a JavaScript script (static/scripts/4-hbnb.js):

Based on 3-hbnb.js
When the button tag is clicked, a new POST request to places_search should be made with the list of Amenities checked
Now you have the first filter implemented, enjoy!



6. States and Cities

Now, reproduce the same steps with the State and City filter:

Replace the route 4-hbnb to 100-hbnb in the file 100-hbnb.py (based on 4-hbnb.py)

Create a new template 100-hbnb.html (based on 4-hbnb.html) and update it:

Import the JavaScript static/scripts/100-hbnb.js in the <head> tag (instead of 4-hbnb.js)
Add to all li tags of each state a new tag: <input type="checkbox">
Add to all li tags of each cities a new tag: <input type="checkbox">
The new checkbox must be at 10px on the left of the State or City name
Add to all input tags of each states (<li> tag) the attribute data-id=":state_id"
Add to all input tags of each states (<li> tag) the attribute data-name=":state_name"
Add to all input tags of each cities (<li> tag) the attribute data-id=":city_id"
Add to all input tags of each cities (<li> tag) the attribute data-name=":city_name"
Write a JavaScript script (static/scripts/100-hbnb.js):

Based on 4-hbnb.js
Listen to changes on each input checkbox tag:
if the checkbox is checked, you must store the State or City ID in a variable (dictionary or list)
if the checkbox is unchecked, you must remove the State or City ID from the variable
update the h4 tag inside the div Locations with the list of States or Cities checked
When the button tag is clicked, a new POST request to places_search should be made with the list of Amenities, Cities and States checked



7. Reviews

Let’s add a new feature: show and hide reviews!

Replace the route 100-hbnb to 101-hbnb in the file 101-hbnb.py (based on 100-hbnb.py)

Create a new template 101-hbnb.html (based on 100-hbnb.html) and update it:

Import the JavaScript static/scripts/101-hbnb.js in the <head> tag (instead of 101-hbnb.js)
Design the list of reviews from this task
Add a span element at the right of the H2 “Reviews” with value “show” (add all necessary attributes to do this feature)
Write a JavaScript script (static/scripts/101-hbnb.js):

Based on 100-hbnb.js
When the span next to the Reviews h2 is clicked by the user:
Fetch, parse, display reviews and change the text to “hide”
If the text is “hide”: remove all Review elements from the DOM
This button should work like a toggle to fetch/display and hide reviews
